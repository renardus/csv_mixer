{"name":"CSV mixer","tagline":"Algebra for CSV files","body":"### Welcome to CSV Mixer.\r\nThe purpose of this gem is to create a CSV file tailored to your programs need. For example we need to combine two CSV files, or we need to rearrange columns, or delete an extraneous column.\r\n\r\n### Operations\r\nThis will contain a list of operations. But this is early days still.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis gem is brought to you by @renardus.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with CSV Mixer? Sorry this is at the moment just a stub.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
